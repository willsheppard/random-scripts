#!env perl

# Input: A long random password
# Output: A special string containing the password hidden in it,
#           to be retrieved by following a set of rules.
#           e.g. Going backwards, take every 3rd character.
# Background: The user has poor impulse control.
#           They password-protect some system,
#           but find themselves retrieving the password,
#           entering it and circumventing their own previous decision.
# Purpose of this program: To provide the user with a way to retrieve
#           their password that is tedious and error-prone.
#           It will be so unpleasant and take so long that their impulse
#           will fade before they have managed to retrieve the password.
# Note: After generating the special string, take a screenshot of it,
#           so that the user cannot copy & paste, and is forced to
#           tediously write the password by hand. Store the screenshot
#           inside a secure password manager system.
# Alternate low-tech solution: Just write the original password
#           on a piece of paper and keep it in hidden away in your house.
